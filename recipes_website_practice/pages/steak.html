                <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, smashed</li>
                <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme</li>

            <h2>Instructions</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Season the steaks generously with salt and pepper on both sides.</li>
                <li>Heat the oil in a large cast-iron skillet over high heat until it just begins to smoke.</li>
                <li>Place the steaks in the skillet and sear for 3-4 minutes on each side until a brown crust forms.</li>
                <li>Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter, garlic, thyme, and rosemary to the skillet.</li>
                <li>Tilt the skillet and spoon the melted butter and herbs over the steaks for about 1-2 minutes, basting continuously.</li>
                <li>Check for doneness: Remove steaks from the skillet when they reach your desired doneness (135Â°F for medium-rare).</li>
                <li>Rest the steaks for 5 minutes on a cutting board to allow juices to redistribute.</li>
                <li>Slice and serve the steaks with the pan juices drizzled on top.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

            <h2>Tips</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Choose the right cut: Ribeye, strip, or filet mignon are great for pan-searing.</li>
                <li>Let the steak rest before slicing to ensure it stays juicy.</li>
                <li>Use a meat thermometer for perfect doneness every time.</li>
            </ul>
